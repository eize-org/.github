# eize (in development)
My personal project where I put what I learn into pratice.

## About eize
**eize** is a dual-sided platform designed to bridge the gap between complex web development and user-friendly content management.
 * **For Users:** It offers a streamlined editing experience where users can customize pre-built templates. By restricting edits to specific semantic fields (e.g., changing product prices or hero images), eize ensures that users can publish professional sites without breaking the underlying design system.
 * **For Developers:** It serves as a marketplace and showcase. Developers can architect sophisticated templates, define custom editable areas, and monetize their work by selling these templates to the user base.
